## Methodology

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Analyze consumption patterns, EV usage, and customer behavior.

2. **Capacity Assessment**  
   Calculate the Consumption-to-Capacity Ratio to identify overloaded substations.

3. **Geospatial Visualization**  
   Map substations and EV stations to evaluate spatial efficiency.

4. **Weather Correlation Analysis**  
   Assess the effect of weather variables on electricity consumption.

5. **Insight Extraction and Visualization**  
   Develop charts, maps, and data-driven recommendations.

## Key Insights

1. **Electricity Consumption**: Most values center around 500 kWh, with spikes suggesting location-based variance.
2. **EV Types & Charging Habits**: Electric scooters are the most common; most users charge daily, creating a steady load.
3. **Customer Type**: The majority of users are commercial, contributing higher overall consumption.
4. **Geospatial Distribution**: EV charging stations are widely dispersed and often far from substations.
5. **Network Capacity**: Some substations show high Consumption-to-Capacity Ratios. Surprisingly, the number of EVs doesn't correlate directly with overload risk.
6. **Weather Influence**: Minimal correlation between consumption and weather, suggesting behavioral and infrastructure-driven usage.

---

## Business Recommendations

1. **Prioritize Substation Upgrades**  
   Upgrade substations and transmission lines with high load ratios or located far from EV charging stations.

2. **Geospatial Planning for Infrastructure**  
   Use spatial analysis to guide placement of new substations or upgrades near high-demand clusters.

3. **Demand-Side Management**  
   Implement incentives (e.g., dynamic pricing) to encourage off-peak EV charging.

4. **Advanced Monitoring and Analytics**  
   Deploy smart monitoring tools for real-time performance tracking and issue prediction.

5. **Cost-Benefit Analysis**  
   Evaluate upgrade options based on financial and operational trade-offs.

6. **Customer Engagement**  
   Communicate transparently about upgrades and improvements to service reliability.

> These actions will help PowerCharge Utilities meet rising EV demands, maintain customer satisfaction, manage infrastructure costs, and ensure grid reliability.
